# -Linux-for-Cloud-DevOps-Engineers
The goal of this project is to build real Linux confidence, not just memorize commands — covering user management, permissions, file systems, text processing, and cloud-integrated storage using AWS EC2 + EBS.  Each lab builds on the previous one and mirrors real-world DevOps tasks you’d expect when working with Linux servers in production.
