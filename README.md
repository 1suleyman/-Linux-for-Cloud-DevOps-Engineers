# 🐧 Linux for Cloud & DevOps Engineers

Welcome to more **Linux learning & practice** 👋
This repository documents a **hands-on Linux project** designed specifically for **Cloud & DevOps Engineers**.

The goal of this project is to **build real Linux confidence**, not just memorize commands — covering user management, permissions, file systems, text processing, and cloud-integrated storage using **AWS EC2 + EBS**.

Each lab builds on the previous one and mirrors **real-world DevOps tasks** you’d expect when working with Linux servers in production.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project focuses on **core Linux skills every Cloud/DevOps Engineer must master**, including:

👤 Linux user & group management <br>
🔐 Permissions, ownership, and access control <br>
📁 Directory & file operations (absolute & relative paths) <br>
📝 Text processing with `sed`, `grep`, and `vi` <br>
🧠 Command-line efficiency & safety <br>
☁️ Cloud-integrated Linux storage (AWS EC2 + EBS) <br>
🧹 Cleanup, auditing, and environment teardown

Each lab is documented in its **own folder** with a README containing:

✅ Step-by-step commands
🐛 Troubleshooting notes
💡 Key takeaways

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

This repository demonstrates:

✔️ Practical Linux skills used daily by DevOps engineers <br>
✔️ Safe system administration practices <br>
✔️ Cloud + Linux integration (EC2 & EBS) <br>
✔️ Clean environment teardown & cost awareness <br>
✔️ Terraform + Linux working together

This is **not a toy project** — it mirrors real operational work.

## 📌 Final Note

> Linux isn’t about memorizing commands —
> it’s about **thinking clearly under pressure on a server you can’t afford to break**.

This project is my way of building that confidence.
